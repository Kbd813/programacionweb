### Links

- Live Site URL: [URL]https://kbd813.neocities.org/reto-2_frontend/index.html

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to use transform to position images on top of each other, and negative margins to compensate for that.


### Continued development

I want to keep learning about the different element positions like fixed, sticky, absolute, etc, they were really tricky to work with.

### Useful resources

- [Recurso 1](https://css-tricks.com/) - This website really helped me understand flexbox, grid and media-queries better
- [Recurso 2](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Finding people struggling with the same issues as me and having other people solve them in different ways gave me several choices to make my own decisions.
